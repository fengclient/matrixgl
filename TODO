. Use a config file for windows and have key to save settings
   . Make the settings button open the config file in notepad
   . Perhaps have the same functionality in *NIX, if 
   --without-xscreensaver  is passed to the configure script. 
   A bash alias would surfice, so I don't know how useful it 
   would be.
. Need to add entry to ~/.xscreensaver, some distros don't do this
. Add additional 3D images, with more variety/characters
. Add ability to pass a directory of jpeg images, which we'll
parse and display instead of the defaults.
. Test on opensolaris
