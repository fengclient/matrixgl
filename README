1. INTRODUCTION
===============
The matrixgl 2.x series is based on the original version 1.0 screensaver from 
Knoppix.ru. It was written by brothers Alexander and Eugene Zolotov back in 
2003. Vincent Launchbury is now maintaining the project, with the goals of:
   * Fixing bugs, and making it run more smoothly.
   * Improving portability, so that it can run on more operating systems.
   * Adding new features and a larger variety of images.

3. DEPENDENCIES FOR *NIX
=========================
The Mac and Windows builds handle dependencies automatically. For all other
*NIX (i.e Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc), you'll need the following packages
for matrixgl to compile and run. If you're not sure what you have, skip ahead
to section 4 below, and follow the instructions. If you're missing something,
the 'configure' script will fail, and tell you what you're missing. You can
then refer back to this section for more details.

i) XLib + development files
      You need to have the X11 libraries and header files. Some distros split
      the header files off into a separate 'devel' package, so if you have X11,
      you might not have everything required. Look through your package manager
      for names including 'xlib', 'libx11' and 'xorg', and read the
      descriptions.
         - Ubuntu packages: libx11-dev

ii) OpenGL + development files
      As with XLib, OpenGL header files aren't always included by default. Look
      through your package manager for names including 'libgl', 'mesa', and
      'opengl', and read the descriptions to find the right ones.
         - Ubuntu packages: mesa-common-dev, libgl1-mesa-dev

iii) OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) + development files)
      You'll also need the header files and libraries for GLU. Look through
      your package manager for names including 'glu', 'mesa' and 'libglu', and
      read the descriptions to find the right ones.
         - Ubuntu packages: libglu1-mesa-dev

iv) A c++ compiler
      You'll need a c++ compiler (to link the GLU library). One example is g++,
      which is bundled with gcc on some platforms. If you don't have one (the
      configure script in section 4 below, will tell you), look through your
      package manager for names including 'g++', 'gcc', or things mentioning
      the GNU Compiler Collection. If gcc isn't supported on your platform,
      another c++ compiler will suffice.
         - Ubuntu packages: g++

v) xscreensaver (OPTIONAL)
      Xscreensaver is an optional dependency, but without it, you may not be
      able to run matrixgl properly as a screensaver. It is highly recommended
      that you use xscreensaver, as it is a fantastic manager. See section 4,
      further down, to see how you can disable xscreensaver support.

If you find that package names are different for your distro, please send me a
list to vincent@doublecreations.com so that I can update this README.
   

4. COMPILING AND INSTALLING ON *NIX
====================================
Packages for *NIX aren't currently provided. You could always ask your distros 
development team to add matrixgl to their repositories, if you don't like 
compiling yourself. 

To extract the source code, fire up a terminal, cd into your download 
directory and type the following commands:
   $tar xzf matrixgl-2.3.1.tar.gz
   $cd matrixgl-2.3.1

Then, to compile and install, run the following commands:
   $./configure
   $make
   (Then, as root)
   #make install

The latter command will install matrixgl into xscreensaver, as well as adding a
man page.  There's still one more step to get it working though, as xscreensaver
won't automatically detect new screensavers when it is run. To get it to see
matrixgl, you'll need to run the following script:
  $./add-user-entry 
which will add the entry for the user that ran the script. This means that each
user that wants to use matrixgl MUST run this script.

To run matrixgl as a screensaver, run 'xscreensaver-demo' and select 'matrixgl'
from the list.  Use the settings dialog to change various settings, such as
color and mode. 

If you don't use xscreensaver, you can run
'./configure --disable-xscreensaver' to build without it. The install command
is still needed so you can run matrixgl from a terminal, or use it with another
screensaver manager. To use with KDE/GNOME, install xscreensaver and see
instructions in the xscreensaver manpage.

For a more advanced install, see the file INSTALL. Note however, that the 
file contains generic instructions not specific to this project.

If for any reason the compilation or installation fails, you can send us
a bug report (described below), and we will get it working for you. It's
easy to do, and will also help out other users in the same situation.


5. INSTALLING ON MAC OSX
========================
Stephane Sudre ported matrixgl to Mac OSX, and it works with OSX 10.4 or later.
The sourcecode is provided in the macsrc/ directory. You can download the mac
installer from either
   http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/matrixgl.html or
   http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/matrixgl/

Note that compiling the mac version from source isn't supported by us.
However, if you run into problems or find a bug, you could report it to
Stephane. See the AUTHORS file for contact information.


6. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
========================
To run on windows, download the installer from the project website. Run it and
follow the instructions. Compiling on windows isn't supported, if you don't
know how to do it, we can't help you.

Please note that as of December 18th, 2009, the windows version of matrixgl is
no longer being actively maintained. However, Michael Hartog still makes
occasional fixes, and the latest windows build is extremely stable.


7. REMOVING MATRIXGL
====================
In *NIX, to remove any files that may have been added, simply run 
'#make uninstall' in the source directory, as root.

In OSX, consult the README in the osx package.

In Windows, to uninstall, open the start menu and go into 
   All Programs > Matrixgl 2.2.9
then click on "uninstall matrixgl" and follow the instructions.


8. SCREENSAVER FUNCTIONS/KEYS
=============================
p - Pause Screensaver at any time
c - View 3D-text credits
s - Toggle classic mode (no 3D images)
n - Cycle through to next image (when not in classic mode)

Note: These keys don't work with xscreensaver, see manpage for details.


9. COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS
===========================
All comments and suggestions are fully welcome. If you have anything to say,
drop me a line at vincent@doublecreations.com. 


10. REPORTING BUGS
==================
If you think you have found a bug in matrixgl, or have any problems compiling,
installing or using it, don't worry, it is very easy to report. To help make it
easier for us to solve the problem, please follow these steps:

1) Open up a terminal and cd into the source directory:
$cd matrixgl-2.3.1

2) Then, run our script that generates a bug report for you:
$./gen-bug-report.sh

The script may ask you for some input, but will run fairly quickly. When it's
done, it will output the file 'bug_report' that contains extremely useful
debugging information. Don't worry, it's just a text file, and contains no
personal information (just open it in a text-editor if you're interested)

3) Email vincent@doublecreations.com with a text description of the problem,
and attach the file 'bug_report' to the email. Please give us as much detail as
possible, so that we have a better chance at fixing the problem.

If you're not sure if something is a bug, it probably is, so please send the
report anyway. As a show of our appreciation for your help, we will add you to
the AUTHORS file as a tester, if you give us your name (and also your
email if you choose).


11. SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
===============================
matrixgl has been tested and confirmed to fully work on the following platforms:
   . GNU/Linux: Gentoo
   . GNU/Linux: Ubuntu
   . GNU/Linux: Debian
   . BSD: Openbsd
   . Mac OSX 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
   . Windows XP 32 bit
   . Windows Vista 32 bit
   . Windows 7 64 bit
If you're platform isn't listed, it will likely still work, it just hasn't been
tested yet. If matrixgl works properly on your OS, you can email the good news
to <vincent@doublecreations.com> and we'll add it to the list above.

12. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
====================
Just a note to put credit where credit is due, I'd like to say that the
original screensaver was developed by brothers Alexander and Eugene Zolotov of
knoppix.ru. I did not write this screensaver, I merely modified it to my
liking, fixing bugs and adding features. But in reality, these are just simple
modifications of a complex and brilliantly designed gem of free software :).
