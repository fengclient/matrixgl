.SH NAME
matrixgl - 3D matrix screensaver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B matrixgl [\fI-CcFfhlsv\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Matrixgl is a 3D matrix screensaver based on The Matrix Reloaded. It features the green scrolling text (or digital rain), that wraps around 3D representations of different characters from the series.
.P
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP 5
-C --color=COL
Set color of the falling text. COL must be one of green, red, blue.
.TP
-c --credits
Show the credits on startup. This option will have no effect if used with --static.
.TP
-F --fs --fullscreen
Run in fullscreen, when run from a terminal. This is the default in xscreensaver.
.TP
-f --fps[=SEC]
Print FPS stats to the terminal every SEC seconds. SEC is clamped to the range 1,20 and defaults to 2 if not given. Note that the first few stats may be inaccurate due to startup delays.
.TP
-h --help
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
-l --limit=LIM
Limit the framerate to LIM fps. Defaults to 32 fps if this option isn't used. LIM is clamped to the range 1,200. Note: Doesn't work well with very small limits (i.e < 10 fps).
.TP
-s --static
Enable static mode, which disables the 3D images, making it look like the plain scrolling text from the original Matrix film.
.TP
-v --version
Output version and author information and exit.
.TP
--allow-root
Allow matrixgl to be run by the root user, if you really want it to. Disabled by default as a safeguard.
.P
Note: Long options may be passed with a single dash.
