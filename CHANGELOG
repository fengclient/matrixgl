. Fixed some sign problems (now gcc error free)

matrixgl-v1.5A (2009/06/2)

   plus, kde changes the directory structure often)

matrixgl-v1.05A   (2008/10/08)

  - rtext_x maintains the width of the 3D 'images'
. Added header file matrix.h to prototype functions
. Moved main() to the top 
. Started editing 3D 'image' data to get seemless edges
  - The extra columns for widescreen setups makes images
      that fade at the edges look very lame.
